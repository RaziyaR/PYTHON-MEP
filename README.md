Employee Data Analysis Project

**Project Overview**

This project involves analyzing employee data from ABC Company to provide valuable insights. The dataset consists of 458 rows and 9 columns. The analysis covers preprocessing, data exploration, and visualization to uncover trends and patterns.

1. Preprocessing Steps

Corrected the height column by replacing its values with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency.

2. Analysis Tasks

Team Distribution: Determined the count and percentage of employees in each team.
Position Segregation: Categorized employees based on their positions within the company.
Predominant Age Group: Identified the most common age range among employees.
Salary Insights: Found the team and position with the highest salary expenditure.
Correlation Analysis: Investigated the relationship between age and salary.

3. Graphical Representations

Bar charts and pie charts were used to visualize team and position distributions.
Histograms and line plots helped identify age trends.
Heatmaps and scatterplots illustrated salary insights and correlations.

4. Insights Gained

Certain teams have a higher proportion of employees, indicating focused resource allocation.
Predominant positions and age groups suggest hiring patterns.
High salary expenditures for specific teams and roles highlight resource prioritization.
A positive correlation between age and salary indicates experience-related compensation.
Submission Details

This project is submitted as a GitHub repository with:
A README summarizing the project.
A well-documented Jupyter Notebook containing code and visualizations.
The dataset used for analysis.

**Conclusion**

This analysis showcases the use of Python for real-world data insights, combining programming, data processing, and visualization skills.
